# About

This project is a Netflix clone built using React, leveraging the power of the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display movie data. The application mimics the core functionalities of Netflix, providing users with a sleek and responsive interface to browse and discover movies and TV shows.

# Key Features

React Frontend: A dynamic and responsive user interface built with React.
TMDB API Integration: Fetches real-time movie and TV show data using the TMDB API.
Axios for API Requests: Efficiently handles HTTP requests with Axios, ensuring smooth data fetching and error handling.
Movie and TV Show Listings: Displays categorized lists of movies and TV shows, similar to Netflix.
Detailed Information Pages: Users can click on a movie or TV show to view detailed information including the description, release date, and rating.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for their favorite movies and TV shows.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

# Usage

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action. Browse through different categories, search for movies, and enjoy the Netflix-like experience.

# Technologies Used

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
